首先引用一段螞蟻書裡關於**pass by value** 及 **pass by reference**的內容

#### 5.9 Passing Arguments By Value and By Reference

> In many programming languages, there are two ways to pass arguments— **pass-by-value**
and **pass-by-reference.**
>
>When arguments are *passed by value*, a *copy* of the argument’s value
is made and passed to the called function.
>
>Changes to the copy do *not* affect an original
variable’s value in the caller.
>
>When an argument is passed by reference, the caller allows the
called function to *modify* the original variable’s value.
>
>Pass-by-value should be used whenever the called function does not need to modify
the value of the caller’s original variable.
>
>This prevents the accidental **side effects** (variable
modifications) that so greatly hinder the development of correct and reliable software systems.
>
>Pass-by-reference should be used only with *trusted* called functions that need to
modify the original variable.
>
>In C, all arguments are passed by value. As we’ll see in Chapter 7, it’s possible to **simulate** pass-by-reference by using the *address operator* and the *indirection operator*.
>
>In
Chapter 6, we’ll see that array arguments are automatically passed by reference for performance reasons.
>
>We’ll see in Chapter 7 that this is not a contradiction. For now, we concentrate on pass-by-value.
